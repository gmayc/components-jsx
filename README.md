### Minimum Requirements (Making a Counter Part I)

For all your components you can use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) components and icons, its already installed for you =). Or you can create your own from scratch.

**\*If you are having trouble with styles, don't worry about it, the main goal is to have all your jsx and components listed below.**

- [ ] Make a class component named NavBar inside the components folder, this must be place on the top part of the application<br>
- [ ] The NavBar must have a button with a refresh icon inside<br>
- [ ] Make a Functional component named Header in components folder, give it a title and place it below the NavBar<br>
- [ ] Make a Class component called InputComp in components folder.<br>
- [ ] InputComp must have an input and a label to specify the maximum count possible<br>
- [ ] Make a Class component called Counter in components folder.<br>
- [ ] The Counter component must have two buttons placed side by side to increment and decrement the counter. Increment must have a + sign/icon and decrement must have a - sign/icon<br>
- [ ] Inside your App component display the counter number. For this part it can be any number.<br>
