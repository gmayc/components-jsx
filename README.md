# Components & JSX

---

### In this exercise you'll test your knowledge about the different types of components available in React and the syntax extension called JSX

- [Functional Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components)
- [Class Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

### Install & Run

1. To install first clone the repo down to your computer
1. Inside the repo folder, run:

   `npm install`

1. Start development server

   `npm start`

1. Change branch to one that has your name:

   `git branch -b <yourname>`

### Minimum Requirements (Making a Counter)

For all your components you can use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) components and icons, its already installed for you =). Or you can create your own from scratch.

- [ ] Make a class component named NavBar inside the components folder, this must be place on the top part of the application
- [ ] The NavBar must have a button with a refresh icon inside
- [ ] Make a Functional component named Header in components folder, give it a title and place it below the NavBar
- [ ] Make a Class component called InputComp in components folder.
- [ ] InputComp must have an input and a label to specify the maximum count possible
- [ ] Make a Class component called Counter in components folder.
- [ ] The Counter component must have two buttons placed side by side to increment and decrement the counter. Increment must have a + sign/icon and decrement must have a - sign/icon
- [ ] Inside your App component display the counter number. For this part it can be any number.

### Final result must look like this
